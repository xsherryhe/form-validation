This project is a simple browser form that implements live inline validation entirely through JavaScript, using custom functions in conjunction with the built-in JS Constraint Validation API.

The project primarily demonstrates use of validation API properties and methods like `validationMessage`, `setCustomValidity`, and `checkValidity` to implement custom validation into an HTML form.
